Elena Phu DOE

Multi modal AI models to understand science problems and work with scientist
Train multiple modals for research, simulation, and coding
DOE has a data explorer with many datasets
Argon NL also has a data sandbox
Having genetic AI systems in the labs. Combine models on robotic hardware in the labs to do research.

CIA chief tech officer Nand mulchandia

OODA loop meets DEVOPS loop. Close kill chains.
Mark to market problem.
Need flexible architecture and systems to react.
CIA is all in on AI and Data.
Top down engineering of application for AI and bottom up architecture 

OSCINT often short hand for social media. Some of the best information we find is still out in newspapers and video.

We deliver so much information to the intelligence community that’s it’s unusable.  Too daunting and too much info.

CIA problems:
We have solved the problem of having too much information. We are changing the workforce to go back and get more info. Using summarization and sourcing. Using chat to ask questions.

Can process quickly.  Can seek and find facial recognition at speed.

What they need:
Fake media. Creating and detecting fake media.  
Looking at narratives more deeply across oscint and make those predications.
Identify collection gaps. Have a whole lot on Russia in this space but need more in this other space.
Provide warning.

Lisa Einstein.  CISA chief Ai officer

Help develop software secure by design. Fuzzing. Type of software testing to provide invalid inputs to software and fix it. Use agents to automate the process. How can our adversaries find or fix our vulnerabilities.

Proactive threat hunt. Red teaming and blue teaming. Protect against malicious actors.

Be obsessed with the problem and not the AI.

Sarah Pierson Defense innovation Unit
What is loitering munitions funding is? Who owns it? What do they need to understand to qualify a project before taking it on?

Help them better understand what the needs are for the DOD through unclassified information.  How do we mine that space to back into understanding who owns the space, where the money is, etc.

Colin's Notes: 

DOE Rep: 
- Ideas: multimodal ai models that can understand scientific papers and take in scientific results and compare to the available literature.
- DOE data explorer, materials data facility 
- Genetic ai system that can work with robots in the lab to run real world experiments 
CTO at CIA: “no intro needed, we are already in your lives one way or another”
- CIA has to power to “great power competition” (economic dominance) and big tech solutions
- “Compiler guy by training”
- OODA loop meets the Dev Ops loop.
- Intel community interested in figuring out what the competition has 
- Importance of being able to quickly react to updates and changes… make sure what is being built in flexible and reactive
- if your not dealing with data and AI, you are probably a organization in decline
- Idea of building systems to automatically vet data and pull the most important insights for the user

OSINT rep: 
- Open Source enterprise: traces roots of open telecom (started 1941 warning of attack)
- Misunderstanding that it’s just data and social media. Sometime most important info is hard copy news or video feeds from terabytes of data. Have been generating too much data for the intel agencies to use.
- They have solved the too much info problem… now focused on collecting more data
- Importance of data curation and answer explanabilty 
- World’s best triage tool
- Automated the process of writing summary’s and reports for the decision makers/warfighter… production documents
- Importance of PROMT ENGINEERING 
- finding new information based off facial info and such
- Need: work on Fake Media/Synthetic media, looking at narratives more deeply to make predictions, providing warning for major events

Lisa Einstein, cheif ai officer at Cyber security and infrastructure secure association: reducing risk of the infurstructiure we rely on
- protecting all .gov
- Protecting private sector healthcare, banking, driving, etc
- Problem: software that is secure by design. “Fuzzing testing” automation and how our adversaries exploit vulnerabilities 
- “We have very motivated adversaries”
- Red teaming and blue teaming through AI agents
- Obsess with the problem, not the AI

Sara Person with DIU: Defense innovation unit
- trace back to 2015 with SecDef Carter
- Helps gov find helpful commercial tech
- Challenge: better understand the needs of the DoD through public info like spending bills
- what is the “color of monies”
- DIU.mil

Person in all black
- cyber security
- How to ease the burden on cyber defenders 
- consider how do we secure AI systems, how can we automate the job of a cyber defender

Guest: Eric, ceo of Google (in a private jet)
- how to get establishment thinker on to a small autonomous model
- Importance of proving your idea
- “My best friend for many years was Henry Kissinngger”
- Developed an interest in “cogs”
- Book starts talking about polymaths, very rare and very valuable
- In the next decade or so, will be possible to have everyone have a polymath on their phone. In 10 years, will have a system in 95th percentile of every field for you to use. What would it be like to live with this? It has no morales
- Reinforcement leading with foundation models.
- The scaling laws may be decreasing
- What happens when people’s best friends are these agents, when they misbehave, when they have access to weapons, when other countries use them: book called Genisus (like the biblical book)
- SCSP was Kissinggers idea. Wrote reports about the problems of the time. 
- Government is good at saying the like people building companies, bad at working with them. It’s very hard to get scalable money. We don’t have a structured model for startup people to works with the Gov untill you have enough revenue to have a sales force and work with the government 
- Don’t use AI models with stocasity do algorithmic tasks… use algorithms (can use ai to create these
- Chairman of a company called sandbox EQ… doing quantum sensing and aggregation: not jammable 
- GPS doesn’t work because it is being blocked across the conflict zone
- Quantum sensing can help with biometric info for health. 
- The GPU ability to do quantum simulation is pretty good
