### Medical Personnel and Resource Allocation Plan for Mortar Attack Victims:

**Patient Allocation Strategy:**

1. **Patient Triage and Assessment**:  
   - **Total Patients**: 100  
   - **Assumed Triage Categories**: 
     - **Severe Trauma**: 30 Patients (Critical injuries needing immediate intervention)
     - **Moderate Trauma**: 30 Patients (Injuries needing monitoring and stabilization)
     - **Minor Trauma**: 40 Patients (Less severe injuries, basic first aid required)

### Resource Allocation Summary:

**1. Beds Allocation:**  
- **Severe Trauma Patients**: 20 Beds  
- **Moderate Trauma Patients**: 10 Beds  
- **Minor Trauma Patients**: 0 Beds (They will wait for first aid)

**2. Medical Personnel Allocation:**  
- **Doctors**:  
  - 2 Doctors assigned to Severe Trauma for surgical interventions  
  - 1 Doctor assigned to Moderate Trauma for monitoring and stabilization  

- **Nurses:**  
  - 1 Nurse assigned to assist in the Surgical area for Severe Trauma  
  - 1 Nurse assigned to assist with Moderate Trauma care  

**3. Blood Units Utilization:**  
- **Severe Trauma Patients**:  
  - 25 out of 30 severely injured patients treated using 50 blood units (predetermined allocation).  

- **Moderate Trauma Patients**:  
  - 5 out of 30 moderately injured patients treated utilizing 5 blood units.  

### Detailed Allocation of Patients, Personnel, and Resources:

| Patient Category    | Total Patients | Assigned Beds | Medical Personnel (Doctors/Nurses)  | Blood Units Used |
|---------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|
| Severe Trauma       | 30             | 20            | Doctor 1, Doctor 2, Nurse 1         | 50 units for 25 patients treated |
| Moderate Trauma     | 30             | 10            | Doctor 3, Nurse 2                   | 5 units for 5 patients treated   |
| Minor Trauma        | 40             | 0             | None (Care for minor injuries only)  | 0 units             |

### Helicopter Transport Plan:  
- **Helicopters Available**: 2 (can transport 4 patients at once)  
- **Transport of Patients**: Use helicopters for critical cases:   
   - 4 patients from severe trauma (stabilized), 1 assigned per helicopter trip.  

### Communication and Continuous Assessment:
- Continuous assessment of all patients every 30 minutes to adapt the treatment plan as necessary.
- Keep track of blood unit availability and patient recovery to redistribute resources if needed.

### Anticipated Patient Outcome:
- 25 out of 30 Severe Trauma Patients successfully stabilized and prepared for surgical interventions within the facility.
- An additional 5 out of 30 Moderate Trauma Patients stabilized for ongoing treatment.
- Efficient use of helicopters aids in transporting critically stable patients to advanced care, ensuring better outcomes post-initial treatment.

This strategic resource allocation plan is designed to maximize patient treatment outcomes and efficiently utilize all available resources during the crisis of the mortar attack.
